# Head Competition
## Head Competition

The Higher Education Analytics Data (HEAD) Competition is an annual event for students to apply analytical skills and storytelling abilities to solve business
problems by exploring available data.
This year the problem presented was to look at parking lot data to identify different user groups by parking duration and to conduct in-depth review of individual lots.

The competition is divided into two phases; Phase I lasted for 6 weeks and we were tasked with cleaning and merging different dataset. 
Phase II lasted for 24 hours, a crunch work period, because we had limited time to understand the problem, analyze the data and find a solution. 

Our team was part of 20 teams to compete in this yearâ€™s competition. In partnership with the City of Hamilton and CityLab, 
we were provided with parking data from 2019 - 2021. Our goal in the project was to look through the data and find a way to optimize user experience, 
using parking lot trends. 

Working on this project gave us an opportunity to use our programming Python skills, learn how to use ArcGIS, and create visualizations using Tableau.
The parking lot data was missing some important information, so we went into the city to locate parking lots that were missing information, 
which gave us an opportunity to explore the City of Hamilton. The business problem allowed us to use some business understanding techniques
to provide customer incentivized solutions. We were challenged to work together as a team, resolve conflicts and disagreements and through
it all find a solution to our common objective.
